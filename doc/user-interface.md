# Notebook user interface

![Alt text](assets/jupiter notebook.png)


When you create a new notebook document, you will be presented with the notebook name, a menu bar, a toolbar and an empty code cell.

Notebook name: The name displayed at the top of the page, next to the Jupyter logo, reflects the name of the .ipynb file. Clicking on the notebook name brings up a dialog which allows you to rename it. Thus, renaming a notebook from “Untitled0” to “My first notebook” in the browser, renames the Untitled0.ipynb file to My first notebook.ipynb.

Menu bar: The menu bar presents different options that may be used to manipulate the way the notebook functions.

Toolbar: The tool bar gives a quick way of performing the most-used operations within the notebook, by clicking on an icon.

Code cell: the default type of cell; read on for an explanation of cells.


Browser Compatibility

The Jupyter Notebook aims to support the latest versions of these browsers:

Chrome
Safari
Firefox

Up to date versions of Opera and Edge may also work, but if they don’t, please use one of the supported browsers.

Using Safari with HTTPS and an untrusted certificate is known to not work (websockets will fail).
