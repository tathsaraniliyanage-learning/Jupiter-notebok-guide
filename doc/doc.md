###  Jupyter notebooks are extremely popular in the Python.

usage :
Jupyter Notebook, provides a fast interactive environment for prototyping and explaining code, 
exploring and visualizing data, and sharing ideas with others.
Jupyter Notebook is often used by programmers, data scientists and students to document and demonstrate
 coding workflows or simply experiment with code.

languages :

The Jupyter system supports over 100 programming languages (called “kernels” in the Jupyter ecosystem) 
including Python, Java, R, Julia, Matlab, Octave, Scheme, Processing, Scala, and many more. 
Out of the box, Jupyter will only run the IPython kernel, but additional kernels may be installed.


Can we write Java code in Jupyter Notebook?

Jupyter notebooks are extremely popular in the Python world, 
simply because it is great to combine documentation 
and code in a visually appealing way. 
Great tool for teaching! Thanks to the IJava kernel and the JDK 9+ JShell feature, 
it is possible to run Java within Notebooks without compiling the code now as well.
